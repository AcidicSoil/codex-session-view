— Single source of truth: All business rules, validation, enums, flags, constants, and config live in the backend. UI is a pure view that reads them via API or shared types. Do not define duplicate rules or values in the frontend. When the UI needs new options or behavior, change the backend model/config first, then consume it from the UI. If you see frontend code copying backend data or logic, refactor to fetch it from the backend.
