# Codex skills usage

- For every UI/frontend related task (new components, refactoring existing component, scanning through existing components, removing/replacing components, etc. ), first interpret the task under the applicable `AGENTS.md` or `AGENTS.override.md`(whichever is available) rules, then apply `$frontend-design` skill.
- Always reference `src/AGENTS.md` or `src/AGENTS.override.md`(whichever is available) and follow section `MODULE AND FILE DESIGN` for all work/tasks performed under `src/`.
- Before ending turn, review work performed this run by referencing all sections under `file size and responsibility rules`. Report your findings if any work performed did not align with the rules.
