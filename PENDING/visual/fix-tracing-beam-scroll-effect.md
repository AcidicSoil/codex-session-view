Then you want the TracingBeam’s `useScroll` to be bound to the scrollable timeline/props container, not the window: create a ref (for example `const containerRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null);`), call `useScroll({ container: containerRef, offset: [...] })` inside TracingBeam, and attach `ref={containerRef}` to the exact `<div>` that has `overflow-y-auto` (or `overflow-y-scroll`) and a fixed height around your props list; remove any bare `useScroll()` without `container`, and make sure no parent further up is the one actually scrolling (page/body can be `overflow-hidden` or just tall enough, but the only element with its own scrollbar for those items must be the one holding `ref={containerRef}`), so that scrolling that props list scrollbar is what drives the tracing-beam effect.
