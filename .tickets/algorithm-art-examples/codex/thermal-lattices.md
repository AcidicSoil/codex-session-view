# Thermal Lattices

Thermal Lattices treats the canvas as a thin plate where heat does not merely diffuse—it organizes. In this movement, temperature is not a color choice but a field: a hidden potential whose gradients sculpt motion. The work rejects “randomness as texture” and instead insists on a meticulously crafted dynamical system, tuned until turbulence reads as intention. Each seed is a new initial condition, not a new idea; the idea is the algorithm itself.

The lattice is not drawn. It emerges when convection-like curls repeat at multiple scales—large, slow cells that shepherd smaller, faster eddies. Particles become probes that reveal this geometry by accumulating traces over time. Their trails behave like long-exposure photography of an invisible fluid: a master-level implementation where every parameter is a lever on the system’s physics, not a cosmetic toggle.

Noise is used as a source of structured uncertainty, layered and cross-coupled so that variation remains bounded. The field is derived from local change (gradients), then rotated into circulation (curl), yielding flow that coheres into cells instead of drifting as static. This is controlled chaos: instability guided by constraints, refined through painstaking optimization so the composition avoids both dead symmetry and noisy collapse.

Color is treated as thermodynamics rather than decoration. Two palette anchors—cool and hot—define a continuum. Each stroke samples a “temperature” value from the field and interpolates between anchors, so hue becomes an instrument panel for the dynamics. The result is not a single image but a living system: reproducible, explorable, and unmistakably authored by deep computational expertise.

Parameter exploration is central to the movement’s ethics. Particle count is density, noise scale is granularity, step size is mobility, trail alpha is memory, flow speed is agitation. The artifact is a laboratory: a rigorously engineered interface that invites the viewer to navigate the seed space and discover stable regimes—where lattices lock in, where they melt, and where they reorganize into new thermal architectures.
