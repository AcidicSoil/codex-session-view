## Algorithmic Philosophy

**Movement: Jacquard Sediment**

Jacquard Sediment treats pattern as a manufactured geology: a field of decisions compacted into cloth. The algorithm is a meticulously crafted machine for producing stable, tileable structure that reads at distance as engineered cells, then resolves up close into quiet deviations—microtexture, warped edges, and deliberate irregularities. Craftsmanship is the point: the work lives in the exact constraints, the careful limits, and the countless iterations that tune chaos into repeatable order.

The core worldview is process-over-product with strict reproducibility. A single integer seed fixes every stochastic choice, so variation is not “randomness” but a controlled family of outcomes. The computation is built around geometry that respects tiling as a first-class law: toroidal distance governs nearest-site selection, and every field used for warping or texture is made seamless by a four-corner blend across the tile domain. This is master-level implementation discipline—no accidental seams, no hidden state drift, no “close enough.”

The “loom whisper” is encoded as a hidden warp–weft lattice that never becomes literal stripes. Sites live on a quantized grid (the loom’s punchcard), but their placement is gently bent by a seamless noise field, creating the feeling of fabric tension and sediment flow without revealing the grid outright. The craftsmanship here is surgical: quantization is strong enough to imprint rhythm, subtle enough to stay invisible, and bent enough to feel alive.

Color is treated as a print-minded material system. Four curated swatches define clean separations (fabric-friendly), while Harmony remaps relationships per cell through restrained hue shifts (analogous/triadic/complement families chosen deterministically per cell). This keeps the series coherent across seeds 1–100, while still producing meaningful variation. Craftsmanship is repeated in every constraint: palette control stays flat enough for textile printing, micro-variation is bounded, outlines are intentional, and the whole surface avoids muddy overdraw.

Finally, the rendering strategy embraces engineered efficiency: precompute site geometry and per-cell color once, then render in a single pass with controlled edge detection (nearest vs. second-nearest distance gap) to produce stained-glass boundaries grown from sediment. The result is a meticulously crafted algorithmic textile system—seamless, reproducible, and deeply tuned—built directly within the provided viewer structure and p5.js best-practice scaffolding.
