**How to use these commands**

Each pnpm command above invokes the **shadcn** CLI via `pnpm dlx` and instructs it to add the corresponding HextaUI block package (e.g., `@hextaui/task-board`) to your project. Run the command in your project’s root directory; it will download the component and update your codebase with the necessary files.
