  T1 Title: Enable vertical scrolling in Chat Dock, AI Analysis, and Hook Discovery results containers

  Type: bug

  Target Area:

    * Main Session Coach view layout/containers (Chat Dock + AI Analysis / Session Intelligence + Hook Discovery results container)

  Summary:

    * Restore vertical scrolling for long conversations and long analysis outputs in the affected view so content is accessible.
    * Ensure Chat Dock and AI Analysis scroll independently (scrolling one does not move the other).

  In Scope:

    * Chat Dock container supports vertical scrolling when content overflows.
    * AI Analysis content area supports vertical scrolling when content overflows.
    * Hook Discovery results container supports vertical scrolling when results overflow.
    * Independent scroll behavior between Chat Dock and AI Analysis when both are visible.

  Out of Scope:

    * “Changing the Session Intelligence experience into a different interaction model… beyond the current view’s fixes.”

  Current Behavior (Actual):

    * Chat Dock and AI Analysis do not scroll; older content/output becomes inaccessible when it exceeds viewport height.
    * Hook Discovery results container does not scroll when overflowing.

  Expected Behavior:

    * Each area scrolls vertically when its content exceeds its visible height.
    * Chat Dock scroll does not move AI Analysis, and AI Analysis scroll does not move Chat Dock.

  Reproduction Steps:

    1. Open the main Session Coach view.
    2. Load a conversation long enough to overflow the Chat Dock viewport.
    3. Attempt to scroll within the Chat Dock.
    4. Generate AI Analysis output long enough to overflow its viewport.
    5. Attempt to scroll within the AI Analysis area.
    6. Run Hook Discovery with enough results to overflow its container; attempt to scroll within results.

  Requirements / Constraints:

    * Scope limited to the specific affected view.
    * Avoid prescribing implementation details (UI/UX and user-facing behavior only).
    * Expected scroll behavior when both containers overflow: Not provided (see Open Items / Unknowns).

  Evidence:

    * “both the Chat Dock container and the AI Analysis content area fail to scroll…”
    * “Hook Discovery: container not scrollable…”

  Open Items / Unknowns:

    * “Define expected scroll behavior when both containers can overflow (…preferred focus, maximum heights, nested vs. single primary scroll region).”

  Risks / Dependencies:

    * Not provided

  Acceptance Criteria:

    * [ ] Given Chat Dock content overflows, scrolling inside Chat Dock reveals older messages without cut-off.
    * [ ] Given AI Analysis output overflows, scrolling inside AI Analysis reveals full analysis without cut-off.
    * [ ] When scrolling inside AI Analysis, Chat Dock content does not move; and vice versa.
    * [ ] Given Hook Discovery results overflow, scrolling inside Hook Discovery results reaches all results.

  Priority & Severity (if inferable from input text):

    * Priority: Not provided
    * Severity: Not provided

  Source:

    * “Chat Dock container… fail to scroll…”
    * “AI Analysis content area fail to scroll…”
    * “Hook Discovery… container not scrollable…”
    * “both… should be scrollable.”
