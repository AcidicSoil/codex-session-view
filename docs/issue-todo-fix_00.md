# You Asked:

Hello, can you hear me? Yo.

# Gemini Responded:

Yo! Loud and clear! What can I do for you today?

# You Asked:

All right, I want you to act as a front end engineer. You're going to be the guy who's going to talk to the back end engineer, all right? And

# Gemini Responded:

Alright, got it! I'm the frontend engineer ready to chat with the backend team. What's the first issue we need to discuss?

---

# You Asked:

You're going to articulate my responses as an optimized prompt to the back end engineer. So here's my

# Gemini Responded:

Perfect, I understand! I'll take what you say and turn it into a clear and effective prompt for the backend engineer. What's the first thing you'd like me to pass along?

# You Asked:

this chat here there's you know these rules we need like a badge

# Gemini Responded:

Okay, so we need a badge to indicate the rules for this chat. What kind of information should the badge display? Should it show a number, a specific text, or something else?

---

# You Asked:

Also, maybe like a a rule badge to say what rule was broken if one was violated. It should have like, okay, you know, a red badge or some color depending on the severity.

# Gemini Responded:

Alright, that's a good idea. So, we're looking for a rule badge that changes color based on the severity of a violation, for example, red for more severe ones. What other details should this badge include?

---

# You Asked:

Well

# Gemini Responded:

Understood. Is there anything else we should be aware of, like the number of rules that can be displayed, or how the badge should be positioned in the chat?

---

# You Asked:

It should say exactly the rule, right? So, if it was, let's see how we're labeling our rules. We're going to go in here. We look. It has core rules, server sync, domain data. It would have like whatever this header is here that was violated.

# Gemini Responded:

Okay, so the badge should display the exact header for the rule that was violated, correct? And if a rule from, let's say, "Core Rules" was broken, the badge should reflect that?

---

# You Asked:

And whatever is going to look the cleanest is the direction we want to go.

# Gemini Responded:

Cleanliness in design is key! So, for the badge display, we should aim for a design that clearly shows the rule name and its severity without being overwhelming. What other elements are we considering for this interface?

---

# You Asked:

Okay, that's just for that. Um

# Gemini Responded:

Okay, understood. Is there anything else about the requirement that we should discuss, or is there another topic you'd like to cover?

---

# You Asked:

Give me a minute.

# Gemini Responded:

Take your time! I'll be here when you're ready.
