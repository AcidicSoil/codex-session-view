# .FILE_UPLOAD_BUTTON_DEBUG_TODO

---

// TODO (fix)

**PROBLEM**

- currently when clicked it will only allow folders

- when clicked the user no longer has the options to load a single file

**FIX**

- when users can load either folder and/or files (single or many)

---

// TODO (fix)

**PROBLEM**

- when files/folders are uploaded, an `uploads` folder is created at .codex/sessions

- files are created in users file system instead of DB

**FIX**

- when `uploads` is no longer created on users filesystem

- when DB is utilized instead

- duplicates are not created, but synced instead
