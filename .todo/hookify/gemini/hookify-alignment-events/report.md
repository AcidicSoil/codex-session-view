I will generate the full solution to enable **Hook Discovery** analysis in your application.

This solution involves:

1. **API Schema Update (`chatbot-api.server.ts`)**: Allowing the `hook-discovery` analysis type.
2. **AI Runtime Logic (`aiRuntime.ts`)**: Injecting the specialized "Conversation Analysis Specialist" system prompt when this mode is triggered.
3. **UI Integration (`SessionAnalysisPopouts.tsx`)**: Adding a button to trigger this analysis from the frontend.

These changes will allow you to run the exact analysis described in your `conversation-analyzer.md` file directly within the Codex Session Viewer.
