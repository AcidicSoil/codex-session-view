### General Rules

— Early development, no users. No backwards compatibility concerns. Do things RIGHT:
organized, zero tech debt. Never create compatibility shims.

- WE NEVER WANT WORKAROUNDS. we always want FULL implementations that are long term
sustainable for many >l000 users. so dont come up with half baked solutions
- Important: Do not remove, hide, or rename any existing features or UI options (even
temporarily) unless I explicitly ask for it. If something isn't fully wired yet, keep the UX surface intact and stub/annotate it instead of deleting it.
