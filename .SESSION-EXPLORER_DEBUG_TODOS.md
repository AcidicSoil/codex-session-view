session explorer still requires a refresh of the window before anything actually shows to
  the user. it still disappears when clicked on, the badge is the only thing clickable, not
  helpful, the whole area should be clickable. repository metadata not shown in the
  sessions loaded from the session explorer.

**EXPLAINATION ON WHY**

- The list collapses because the component toggles its own expanded state on click, and your hydration conditions cause the client render to disagree with the server-rendered open state, so React replaces the section with its fallback and the list vanishes. This comes from a mismatch between SSR output and the client’s first render (timezone, dynamic size calculation, Date objects, or any non-deterministic value used to compute whether a group is expanded). The UI then re-renders in the collapsed state, so it looks like it disappears the moment you interact with it.
